This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project.

## Getting Started

1. Install packages. I used `bun`, but `npm` should just work fine.

```bash
bun install
# or
npm install
```

2. Build
```bash
bun run build
# or
npm run build
```

3. Start
```bash
bun run start
# or
npm run start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
